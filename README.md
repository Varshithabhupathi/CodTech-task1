**Objective**: The Arduino LED blinking project provides a hands-on introduction to microcontrollers, hardware interfaces, and programming ideas.


**Key Activites**<br> 

1.LED Connections: Connect the LED to the breadboard. <br>
2.Resistor Connection: Insert one end of the resistor into the same row of the breadboard as the LED's Anode. <br>
3.Ground (GND) Connection: Connect a jumper wire from the same row as the LED's cathode to any Arduino board GND (Ground) pin. <br>
4.Upload code: Upload the code from system to the Arduino board using USB cable. <br>
